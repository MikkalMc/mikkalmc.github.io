There are a couple of things I would like to document within this blog. I will be focusing on my experiences as a Software Engineer including: the multitude of work cultures, technical learnings, and other general topics within that realm. A bit about me, my name is Mikkal McNulty and I'm currently an upcoming senior in college wrapping up my Computer Science degree. I've had the privledge of (to an extent) working in the industry since the beginning of my college experience.

My first introduction to this world was when I began my first software job working in a campus affiliated "start up" called CSUN META+Lab. I put quotations around the word start up because it was not necessarily a start up but marketed itself as one. In reality, it was a non-profit web development agency funded by the school, we took on clients ranging from the Los Angeles Police Department, California State Universities, and other academic organizations. From here, I grew my skills in application development thanks to the tools and frameworks PHP Laravel and Vue.js (who I still swear by to this day). Learning best practices such as test driven development, domain driven design, event sourcing, etc, I was able to gather the confidence to begin the search and grind for real industry experience. 

In the fall of 2018, I was estatic to accept a 6 month long internship at one of my dream companies, Tesla. I will likely write an entire blog post detailing my experiences at this company as there were many career defining moments experienced. I will say now however, that Tesla as a whole is an amazing company and I was blessed to work with amazing talented talented individuals.

Back to today! I am now half student, half software engineer at the company Medtronic, where I get to write software and tools that affect the lives and wellbeings of patients. Just like my experiences at Tesla, I plan on writing an entire blog post to elaborate my experiences at Medtronic as a SWE. 

All this being said, I am extremely priveledged to be given these opportunities throughout time. There were definitely many times where I struggled, fell flat, and couldn't find the balance between academic endevours and industry endevours. I hope that through writing these blog posts I will be able to excite upcoming software engineers, learn some new things about myself, and essentially document my life lolll. 

Thanks for reading.
